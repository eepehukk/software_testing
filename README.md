# Todo list application — a demo web app for practicing software testing

## About

A simple web application that allows users to create and manage todos.

Features include:

- 🪪 User authentication (register, login, logout)
- 📋 Create, read, update, delete todo lists
- 📝 Create, read, update, delete todo items within a list
- 🖨️ Clone todo lists (copy all items to a new list)
- 🤝 Share todo lists with other users
- 📺 Live updates (websockets) for shared lists

The application includes the following four services.

- `frontend` — a web application implemented in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Astro](https://astro.build/), [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/), and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- `backend` — a REST API implemented with [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)
- `database` — a [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database
- `database-migration` — a database migration service ([Refinery](https://github.com/rust-db/refinery)) for incremental database schema updates

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

### Running the Application

In the project directory, run

```
docker compose up
```

Open `http://localhost` in a browser.

### Development

In the project directory, run

```
docker compose -f compose.dev.yml up
```

Open `http://localhost:4321` in a browser.

The development environment includes hot reloading for the frontend and backend services.

### Switching between environments

Once you have created the containers and want to switch the compose configuration file, the database containers should be removed. Otherwise they will be run use with the old configuration of the previous `compose up` command.
This can be done for both configurations with

```
docker compose down --remove-orphans
```

### Test run command

```
docker compose down --remove-orphans ; rm -rf database/psql_data ; docker compose -f compose.dev.yml up -d --build frontend-dev backend-dev database-dev database-migration-dev robot-tests ; sleep 40 ; docker logs software_testing-robot-tests-1
```
