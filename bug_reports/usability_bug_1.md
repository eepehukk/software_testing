# Usability bug 1 | Manual testing

If somebody has shared you a empty todo list and you are listed as a viewer it still gives you an option to add todos. It doesn´t allow you to add the todo but still it gives out the text field to add one. It is unnecessary to even have that text field visible and it might confuse possible users.
